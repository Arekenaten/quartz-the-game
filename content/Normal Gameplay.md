The period of time where one or more players are actively engaged in playing [[The Game]]. Normal Gameplay cannot be stopped for the purpose of calling a [[The Conclave of Players|Conclave of Players]]. At the beginning of every session of engaging in playing The Game, players commit to see the session through with the current set of Meta Rules in place. It's hilarious.

During Normal Gameplay, and in any [[The Rules|Rules]] referencing it, [[The Gamekeeper]] is generally not considered a “Player”.
