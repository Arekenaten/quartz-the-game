### There are three main types of Rules

#### Universal Rules
Rules which are in effect at all times, impose something on the entire [[Gameplay Universe]], or are agreed upon as universal by a majority of players.

Examples:

- “Players are represented by characters or forces in the world and can take a series of actions on their turn unless under an effect which disallows taking actions.”
	- A contrived example, but a good example of how breaking this rule would break the game.
- “Players are not allowed to harm one another through direct or intentional actions.”
	- An example of a global rule. As it takes precedence over others, there can be no scenario until this rule is changed where it is broken, even though the game wouldn’t break if it were.

These rules are considered "firmer" than Local Rules, and take precedence in any rule conflict. These rules must be followed by all players at all times (including [[The Gamekeeper]]) and may only be modified or removed by a [[Definitions#Majority of Players|Majority of Players]] during [[Normal Gameplay]] or at a [[The Conclave of Players|Conclave of Players]].

#### Local Rules
Rules which are in effect only under specific circumstances of gameplay. They are typically designed to be more easily circumvented than Universal Rules. These rules may be added by [[The Gamekeeper]], or by a [[Definitions#Simple Majority of Players|Simple Majority of Players]].

Examples:
- “Whenever a player reaches 0 hit points, they enter a state of un-death and can haunt players to reduce their attack.”
	- This rule could be circumvented by a player casting a “Ward undead” spell in game, etc.
- “Players are not allowed to harm one another through direct or intentional actions while in camp or while a player has a white bandana on.”
	- This is a much more specific rule than the similar global rule above, with clear restrictions.

In the event of rule conflicts within the Local Rules between rules established by the players and [[The Gamekeeper]], rules created by the players take precedence. However, The Gamekeeper reserves the right to veto or otherwise modify rules which violate [[The Principles of The Game]].

#### Transient Rules
Rules which are temporary or limited in nature, or which only impact a single interaction within [[The Universe]]. These rules could possibly more accurately be referred to as "effects" or even "actions". They take the least amount of precedence in any rule conflicts. [[The Gamekeeper]] has the authority to modify, remove, or add these rules at will. These are also typically the kinds of rules players will request to add during their turn in Normal Gameplay to gain a creative advantage. 

Given The Gamekeeper has sole authority to establish these rules, it is a responsibility of The Gamekeeper to limit the scope of these types of rules and reject them when they are un-fun or provide too great an advantage to any subset of players.

Examples:
- “Players wearing red are immune from fire damage for 2 turns.”
	- A highly specific rule, limited by both temporal and material requirements.
- “You are charmed by your fellow player’s wit, and have to stop attacking them until you sleep.”
	- Rules impacting only one player are usually considered Transient (even if they are “permanent” effects)
