A special gathering of players of The Game. This event can usually only be initiated by [[The Gamekeeper]], and only outside of the bounds of [[Normal Gameplay]]. The Game Keeper may not stop a period of Normal Gameplay in order to call a Conclave of Players.

The Conclave of Players is the only forum in which [[The Meta Rules]] may be amended.
