In this context, this means rules *about* rules. These are a set of fundamental, unchangeable rules of [[The Game]]. Everything on this page is considered a Meta Rule, as well as anything on any page tagged with the #Rules/Meta-Rule tag.
## Foundations
### Meta Rules may not be changed during [[Normal Gameplay]]
Under no circumstance during [[Normal Gameplay]] can: 
- an existing Meta Rule be changed,
- an existing Meta Rule be removed,
- a new Meta Rule be added
[[The Gamekeeper]] may make amendments to Meta Rules only via a [[The Conclave of Players|Conclave of Players]]
### Players may propose new [[The Rules|Rules]] during [[Normal Gameplay]]
At any point during their turn, a player may propose a new Rule to [[The Gamekeeper]]. If The Gamekeeper chooses to accept the new rule, it becomes binding on gameplay immediately. Rules are not retroactive by default but can be specified as retroactive in the request. New rules may not in any way modify the Meta Rules, and Meta Rules always take precedence on any conflict in ruling.
